Jake and I created Jborg2 (Jake + Ben + Organization + 2 ) in 2023. We share similar values and unique skill sets, empowering us to create, innovate, and iterate on a range of projects. We're most passionate about building technology that creates value for all stakeholders, not just us and investors.

## About Ben

Hey, it's me, Ben. As of May 2023 I'm finishing up my MBA at [Kennesaw State University]() while Jake and I build momentum for Jborg2. I already have a B.B.A from the University of Georgia (go dawgs)! My skill set ranges from frontend development all the way into data science and machine learning. I'm an avid user of both Next.js and FastAPI.
