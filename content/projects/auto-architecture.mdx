## Introduction 
Auto Architecture is a web application that leverages the power of GPT-4 to automatically generate and visualize recommended AWS architectures based on a user's project description. This is an experiment into automated infrastructure suggestions.

## How it works
Auto Architecture takes in a user's input for an application they would like to create. 
It then sends a request to GPT-4 to retrieve suggestions for AWS architectures to deploy the 
application on. The app uses guardrails to ensure that outputs are in a graph-like format. 
This format includes edges between dependent services and a description of the overall
architecture. Descriptions of individual service usage are also retrieved. The graph is
then rendered on a js canvas using D3.js.
