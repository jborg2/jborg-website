## Introduction

This is Semantics Cloud. Over time, we found ourselves building more and more embedded search applications. I build my first one, the original "Semanitcs Cloud" back in early-2022 before the advent of tools like [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) and newer LLMs like [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). Nowadays, I can use a library like [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to spin up a full-stack embedded search app for a PDF in an hour or two, max. Most of the complexity with embedded search doesn't arise until you start to scale. We needed a super fast, super scalable, super reliable, and super cheap embedded search solution. This is why we built Semantics Cloud. 

## How It Works
Semantics cloud uses a rust API built with actix as its backend. A local SQLite  database is created to store project and user information. 
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to store embedding vectors in memory and quickly find K nearest neighbords. Future plans
for this project include cluster-based index memory management. 

## API endpoints
