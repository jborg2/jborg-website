## Introduction

This is the first project that Jake and I (Ben) worked on together. We picked it as a first project because we thought it would be a good way to learn each other's workflow and because we could use it as an internal tool. The reason we probably wouldn't have done this project otherwise is that there's a big risk that an incumbent like GitHub would just add this feature to their existing platform and make this app obsolete.

## How It Works

AutoDoc works in 2 parts. The first is static analysis, and the second is documentation generation via a Large Language Model. 
The static analysis module creates a call graph of the code base. This call graph contains edges between methods that call each other. 
For example, if method a calls methods b and c, the call graph contains the following edges: [[a, b], [a, c]]. Autodocs then uses 
the LLM to summarize methods starting at the highest topological level of the call graph (leaf nodes). Once all called methods for a
 method are summarized, the description of the called methods is injected as comments into the caller method before it is summarized. 
 Finally, each file is summaries with its called method summaries injected as comments.
