## Introduction

This is the first project that Jake and I (Ben) worked on together. We picked it as a first project because we thought it would be a good way to learn each other's workflow and because we can use it as an internal tool. The reason we probably wouldn't have done this project otherwise is because there's a big risk that an incumbent like GitHub would just add this feature to their existing platform and make this app obsolete.

## How It Works

AutoDoc works in 2 parts. First is the static analysis, second is the documentation generation via a Large Language Model.
